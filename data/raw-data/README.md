This folder should contain all raw data. 

The data in this folder should contain uncleaned csv files conatining information on the game, publisher, userscore, and other variables needed in the analyzing of user sentiment for AAA titles.

There is also another folder related to the cleaning of data and the breakdown of variables

PSA [as of 6/14/2024] I am still researching all of the titles that are considered AAA and am compiling my findings in an xml file that will be added as soon as possible.
